Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography with Python
Overview
This project demonstrates image steganography using Python and OpenCV. It allows users to hide a secret message inside an image and later retrieve it using a passcode. The encryption process modifies the least significant bits (LSB) of the image pixels to store the message, ensuring minimal distortion of the image.

Features
Encrypt a secret message: Hide a text message inside an image.
Decrypt the hidden message: Extract the original message using the correct passcode.
Passcode Protection: Only users with the correct passcode can retrieve the hidden message.
User Input for File Paths: Users specify the image file path at runtime.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
To install the required dependencies, run:

pip install opencv-python
How to Use
Encryption
Run encrypt.py:
python encrypt.py
Enter the full path of the image.
Enter the secret message you want to hide.
Enter a passcode for decryption.
The encrypted image (encryptedImage.png) will be saved in the same directory.
Decryption
Run decrypt.py:
python decrypt.py
Enter the full path of the encrypted PNG image.
Enter the passcode used during encryption.
If the passcode matches, the hidden message will be revealed.
File Descriptions
encrypt.py - Encrypts a message into an image.
decrypt.py - Decrypts the message from the encrypted image.
passcode.txt - Stores the passcode used for encryption.
msg_length.txt - Stores the length of the hidden message.
encryptedImage.png - Output image with the hidden message.
Notes
Only encrypted images of PNG format should be used for decryption since using JPG causes data loss during compression.
The image should be large enough to store the message.
Do not modify passcode.txt or msg_length.txt, as they are needed for decryption.
When using the command prompt to run the python files, the present working directory has to be the same directory where the python files are located.
